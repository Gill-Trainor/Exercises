    <h1 id="title1"> My Motivation for Coding</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Challenging Myself</li>
        <p>I decided to learn coding in order to learn a new skill. I have always had a desire to learn the skills
            necessary to code and program, and have finally decided it is time to do so. I am excited for the challenges
            I will face and the opportunity to overcome them!</p>

        <li>My Goals</li>
        <p> I will absolutely give 110% at all times! I will work hard until I am capable of
            transitioning into a career involving coding/programming! I will not let mistakes discourage me, and will
            find new creative solutions to programming challenges I face! These are my three goals!</p>

        <li>Have Fun!</li>
        <p>I am already enjoying coding, and I think I will greatly enjoy the challenges that I come across and all of
            the lessons I will learn! If you are not having fun coding, then you are coding incorrectly!</p>
    </ul>
